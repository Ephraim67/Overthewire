# The Level Goal
This level allows you to login to the game through ssh connection. Th host was provided which is  bandit.labs.overthewire.org and 
the port to connect is on port 2220.

## WHat is SSH?
The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operatin network services securely over an insecure network.
Its most notable applications are remote login and command line execution.

SSH was designed for Unix-like operating systems as a replacement for Telnet and unsecured remote Unix shell protocols, 
such as the Berkeley Remote Shell (rsh) and the related rlogin and rexec protocols, which all use insecure, plaintext methods of 
authentication, like passwords.

## Steps

Step 1: Identify the correct port
SSH uses port 22 by default, but Overthewire uses a different port for the Bandit game which is on port 2220.

Step 2: Use the SSH Command with the specified port
To connect to **bandit0** level, specify the port in your SSH command like this:
          ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

* bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org: This is the username and hostname for the Bandit server.
* -p 2220: This flag specifies the port number. In this case, it is 2220.

Step 3: Enter the Password
Once you run the command, youâ€™ll be prompted to enter the password. For bandit0, the initial password is usually provided on 
the OverTheWire Bandit website.
           ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Then enter the password: <check your task>

The password is: <find it yourself>
